      \subsection{ Working of the project }
      \begin{list}{$\cdot$}
      \item This project has mainly 3 parts.    1. Implementation algorithms using java 2. Python GUI   3. Interface using Django
      \item PART 1.
      \item User enters the information like Unique id, choices, category preferences, and additional information
      \item We have created functions to manipluate all the data.
      \item There are 4 classes, 1. Candidate 2. VirtualProgramme  3. MeritList 4.GaleShapleyAdmission
      \item There are 2 algorithms used here.   1. Modified Gale- Shapely Stable Matching Algorithm  2. Merit List order Allocation
      \\
      \item  PART 2
      \item  First we converted the pdf into text using pdftotext shell command.
      \item  Then we read the values in it by the python program update.py and output it in a .csv file

      \begin{list}{$\cdot$}
      \item User 1- Rohan made the python code update.py  and p1.py for the web interface and designed 2 classes in lab 10
      \item User 2- Chandra designed algorithms for lab 10 part
      \item User 3- Ayush helped in lab 10 gayle shapley and made the Django interface
      \item All tasks were done by all 3 of us in group.
